Hi there!

If you've somehow stumbled across this repo ~~(or rather got a link sent to it lmao)~~, then great. This is where I store all my handouts, typed and compiled in Typst. I hope this will be useful for anyone studying Maths or Physics, and perhaps my style of writing notes will grow on you as well.
